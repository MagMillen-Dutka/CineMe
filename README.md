# CineMe - A user friendly front-end application

## Description

A user friendly application designed to view different ratings of Tv shows to help you decide the show you want to watch. 

This encompasses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery into one application with zero pre-existing code. It is styled via standard style.css file, along with the use of w3.CSS inline styling components.

## User Story
As a film fan I want to be able to quickly see top trending shows, or the ones i search so that I can choose the one that I would enjoy to watch.

## Our Motivation

We decided on a quick project topic. With our enjoyment for Tv-shows also, gave us that momentum to dive a little deeper onto our projects and think about it with future developments in mind. But also think easily from a users perspective. As we all have tv-show memberships.

## Instalation

No instalation is required simply search for the website.

## Usage 

Users on the website can view reviews of movies and shows from external reviewing website, presenting an overall community-driven rating. These ratings often serve as a quick reference for potential viewers, offering insights into the general consensus on a particular piece of content. Users typically visit these websites to discover new content, get a sense of popular movies, and gauge the quality of productions before investing their time.

## Our Difficulties

-API sourcing: First was paid IMDb API ratings which was scrapped, Second was RottenTomatos API ratings which was ceased in updates and in conclusion we have found a free usage of TVmaze API

-A lot or merch conflicts: We've had simultaneous changes to the coding most of the time conflicting with other members as at the start we were also uploading staright to the main branch without waiting on the other teamm members to upload. As some of us were editing the same file. Sometimes we were also merging to the main branch, bypassing without the reviewer's knowledge. We have also struggled a lot with the details of functions on github like issue viewing, branch switching, assigning reviewers and labels to commits. 

-Communication Issues: Lack of effective communication which lead to misunderstandings and errors as well as mixing of issues (tickets) as they were not so detailed as well. To counter this we some what established a clear communication channel - Slack and Zoom. Although we had communication applications, we still struggled to create time as everyone had differnet schedules. And so we used most of lesson times to come together to discuss our progress and notify each other about possible conflicts and code changes later on. Lack of communication had also slowed down our pacing on the project significantly. And sadly was unable to speed up. 

-Skill Disparities: Everyone had different strengths and weaknesses. It did slow us down again but the counter argument would be that we were reassurred by each others commitments and knowledge in a specfic topics. We did have a great project leader.

-Lack of Testing: Missing deadlines as individuals missed out from communicating within each other and not moving or passing tasks when challenged with issues. Little testing was achieved unfortunately.

## Our Successes

## Our Future Targets

-Users will be able to create accounts/profiles and be able to save shows that they like and rate from our website. Providing this platform also for tv-show enthusiasts to create engagement with each other. Sharing their opinions, theories and general discussions of their favorite shows and characters within. This will foster a sense of community among the show. Turning 'show-watching' into a more of an interactive experience. The website could also incorporate features like live polls and quizzes. Allowing users to actively engage with each other in real-time.

-To add movies within our website.

-Embracing and promoting experimental community created films or unconventional films. This could include a focus on avant-garde cinema, indie films, or movies that challenge traditional storytelling norms.

-Festive UIs to create a virtual space for the fans, and allowing those users to experience and rate festival films online. This could democratize access to festival content and provide a unique platform for independent filmmakers. As well as creating a tailord experience for the users.

-Speaking of tailord experience, we would like to expand on unique search ways such as genres, year of makes and rating districts. Users can also follow these segments to see any new releases.

-Branching out to actor/actress biographies. Creating wider usage on discussions and expansion on unique topics.

## Acceptance Criteria
When a user opens the application they should be able to see:
* A title for the application.
* A search bar to search by movie title.
* An image detailing film characters by famous actors / actresses.
* A description of the application for users to see.
* Images of top-trending films.
* Upon searching for a film the user will be presented with the title, a brief description and a rating for the film.
